# Undergrad-Thesis-Project--Object-Detection-System

This project presents a color and shape sorting system solution with the application of image
processing. Image processing procedure senses the objects in an image captured in real-time by a
camera and then identifies color and information out of it. It is a project based on Image processing
and robotics used to identify and sort objects based on their color and shape. This system provides
a simplified and efficient method to sort objects by capturing an image of the object to be analyzed
in Python 3.7.1 software and use efficient algorithms to identify the color and shape of the object.
A camera is used to obtain an image of the target object which is used for analysis. A robotic arm,
which is controlled by an Arduino Uno microcontroller, is used for the ‘pick up and drop’ operation
to sort the object and place it in the desired position.
